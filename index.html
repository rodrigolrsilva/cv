  For search engine optimization, getting ranking for certain keywords and such, this is something Google looks at to try
to figure out what your webpage is about.
If a file name is used instead of an URL, the filename will suffice, since it'll be in the same folder as the html file,
as in algeciras.png . If it was in an images folder, I'd need to add a path to get there.-->
